I have learnt alot about HTML syntax and the standard template for writing HTML, so far learning the syntax has been easy as i have had prior knowledge on the subject at hand. I can now write HTML elements like; <div></div>, <img/>, <p></p>, <strong></strong>, <em></em>, <sub></sub>, <sup></sup>, <strike></strike>, <b></b> and <a></a>. And so far nothing has been difficuilt.
